## Plug-Ins
From the word of SEC president Jeremy Martin, the following plugins are recommended:
World Gaurd
Chest Lock

Given the above plugins, the server acheives:
- protection against one or more actions involving blocks or items, invoking specified measures taken against the invoking player.
- additional commands such as /god and /heal and emergency commands, such as stopping fire spread.
- setup 3-dimentional zones in world to protect spawn and other areas of world, create places where players can own plots, prevent PvP combat in neutral zones, and more.
- lock chests by placing a sign on the chest you want to lock

This document identifies the following Spigot/Bukkit plugins:
- LockettePro: place a sign on your chest to prevent other players from accessing its contents (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lockettepro-for-1-14-1-15-1-16.74354/)
